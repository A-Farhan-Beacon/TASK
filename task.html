        <strong>KAABA</strong>
    </h1>
    <section>
        <h2>
            The Kaaba (Arabic: ٱلْكَعْبَة‎, romanized: al-Kaʿbah, lit. 'The Cube', Arabic pronunciation: [kaʕ.bah]),
            also
            spelled Ka'bah or Kabah, sometimes referred to as al-Kaʿbah al-Musharrafah (Arabic: ٱلْكَعْبَة
            ٱلْمُشَرَّفَة‎,
            romanized: al-Kaʿbah al-Musharrafah, lit. 'Honored Ka'bah'), is a building at the center of Islam's most
            important mosque, the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.[1][2] It is the most sacred site in
            Islam.[3]
            It
            is considered by Muslims to be the Bayt Allah (Arabic: بَيْت ٱللَّٰه‎, lit. 'House of God') and is the
            qibla
            (Arabic: قِبْلَة‎, direction of prayer) for Muslims around the world when performing salah.

            In early Islam, Muslims faced in the general direction of Jerusalem as the qibla in their prayers before
            changing the direction to face the Kaaba, believed by Muslims to be a result of a Quranic verse
            revelation
            to
            Muhammad.[4]

            The Kaaba is believed by Muslims to have been rebuilt several times throughout history, most famously by
            Ibrahim
            (Abraham) and his son Ismail (Ishmael), when he returned to the valley of Mecca several years after
            leaving
            his
            wife Hajar (Hagar) and Ismail there upon Allah's command. Circling the Kaaba seven times
            counterclockwise,
            known
            as Tawaf (Arabic: طواف‎, romanized: tawaaf), is a Fard

    <h2>(obligatory) rite for the completion of the Hajj
        and
        Umrah pilgrimages.[3] The area around the Kaaba on which pilgrims circumambulate is called the Mataaf.

        The Kaaba and the Mataaf are surrounded by pilgrims every day of the Islamic year,

        except the 9th
        of Dhu
        al-Hijjah, known as the Day of Arafah, on which the cloth covering the structure, known as the Kiswah
        (Arabic:
        كسوة‎, romanized: Kiswah, lit. 'Cloth') is changed. However, the most significant increase in their
        numbers
        is
        during Ramadan and the Hajj, when millions of pilgrims gather for Tawaf.[5] According to the Saudi
        Ministry
        of
        Hajj and Umrah, 6,791,100 pilgrims arrived for the Umrah pilgrimage in the Islamic year 1439 AH,[a] a
        3.6%
        increase from the previous year, with 2,489,406 others arriving for the 1440 AH Hajj.[6] The literal meaning of
        the word Ka'bah (Arabic: كعبة‎) is cube.[7] In the Qur'an, from the era of the life of Muhammad, the Kaaba is
        mentioned by the following names:

        al-Bayt (Arabic: ٱلْبَيْت‎, lit. 'the house') in 2:125 by Allah[Quran 2:125][8]
        Baytī (Arabic: بَيْتِي‎, lit. 'My House') in 22:26 by Allah[Quran 22:26][9]
        Baytik al-Muḥarram (Arabic: بَيْتِكَ ٱلْمُحَرَّم‎, lit. 'Your Inviolable House') in 14:37 by Ibrahim[Quran
        14:37]
        al-Bayt al-Ḥarām (Arabic: ٱلْبَيْت ٱلْحَرَام‎, lit. 'The Sacred House') in 5:97 by Allah[Quran 5:97]
        al-Bayt al-ʿAtīq (Arabic: ٱلْبَيْت ٱلْعَتِيق‎, lit. 'The Ancient House') in 22:29 by Allah[Quran 22:29]
        According to historian Eduard Glaser, the name "Kaaba" may have been related to the southern Arabian or
        Ethiopian word "mikrab", signifying a temple.[10] Author Patricia Crone disputes this etymology.[11]</h2>

    <h1>
        <strong>MEDINA</strong>
    </h1>
    <section>
        <h2>
            Medina,[a] officially Al Madinah Al Munawwarah (Arabic: المدينة المنورة‎, romanized: al-Madīnah
            al-Munawwarah, lit. 'The Enlightened City', Hejazi pronunciation: [almadiːna almʊnawːara]), commonly
            simplified as Madīnah or Madinah (Arabic: المدينة‎, romanized: al-Madina, Hejazi pronunciation:
            [almadiːna]), is the second holiest city in Islam and the capital of the Medina Province of Saudi Arabia.
            The 2020 estimated population of the city is 1,488,782,[2] making it the fourth-most populous city in the
            country.[3] Located at the core of the Medina Province in the western reaches of the country, the city is
            distributed over 589 square kilometers (227 square miles), 293 km2 (117 sq. mi.) of which constitutes the
            city's urban area, while the rest is occupied by the Hejaz mountain range, empty valleys, agricultural
            spaces and older dormant volcanoes.

            The city is considered to be the second-holiest of three cities in Islamic tradition, the other two being
            Mecca and Jerusalem. The Masjid al-Nabawi ('Prophet's Mosque') built by Muhammad in 622 CE, is of
            exceptional importance in Islam and is the site of burial of the last Islamic prophet. Muslims visit his
            rawdhah in what is known as Ziyarat at least once in their lifetime, although this is not obligatory.

        [4] The
        original name of the city before the advent of Islam was Yathrib (Arabic: يَثْرِب‎) and it is referred to by
        the same name in the Qur'an in Chapter 33, al-Ahzab (The Confederates). It was renamed Madīnat an-Nabī (City
        of the Prophet or The Prophet's City) after Muhammad's death and later al-Madinah al-Munawwarah (The
        Enlightened City), before being simplified and shortened to its modern name, Madinah (The City), written in
        English as Medina. Saudi Arabian road signage uses Madinah and al-Madinah al-Munawwarah interchangeably.[4]

        The city existed for over 1,500 years before Muhammad's migration from Mecca,[5] otherwise known as the
        Hijrah. Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim caliphate under Muhammad's leadership, serving
        as its base of operations and as the cradle of Islam, where Muhammad's Ummah (Community), composed of the
        citizens of Medina, known as the Ansar and those who immigrated with Muhammad, known as the Muhajirun,
        collectively known as the Sahaba, gained huge influence. Medina is home to three prominent mosques, namely
        al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Masjid Quba'a, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn, with the masjid at Quba'a being the oldest in
        Islam. A larger portion of the Qur'an was revealed in Medina in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs.[6][7]

        Much like most of the Hejaz, Medina has seen numerous exchanges of power within its comparatively short
        existence. The region has been controlled by Arabian Jewish tribes (up to the 5th century CE), the 'Aws and
        Khazraj (up to Muhammad's arrival), Muhammad and the Rashidun (622–660 CE), Umayyads (660–749 CE), Abbasids
        (749–1254 CE), the Mamluks of Egypt (1254–1517 CE), the Ottomans (1517–1805 CE), the First Saudi State
        (1805–1811 CE), Muhammad Ali Pasha (1811–1840 CE), the Ottomans for a second time (1840–1918), the Hashemite
        Sharifate of Mecca (1918–1925 CE) and finally is in the hands of the modern-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
        (1925–present CE).[4]

        In addition to visiting for Ziyarah, tourists come to visit the other prominent mosques and landmarks in the
        city that hold religious significance such as Mount Uhud, Al-Baqi' cemetery and the Seven Mosques among
        others. Recently, after the Saudi conquest, the Saudis carried out a demolition of several tombs and domes
        in and around the region fearing these might become sites of association of others in worship beside Allah
        (shirk).[8]

        <strong>AL-AQSA</strong>
    </h1>
    <section>
        <h2>
            l-Aqsa Mosque (Arabic: ٱلْمَسْجِد ٱلْأَقْصَىٰ‎, romanized: al-Masjid al-ʾAqṣā, IPA: [ʔælˈmæsdʒɪd ælˈʔɑqsˤɑ]
            (About this soundlisten), "the Farthest Mosque"), located in the Old City of Jerusalem, is the third holiest
            site in Islam. The mosque was built on top of the Temple Mount, known as the Al Aqsa Compound or Haram
            esh-Sharif in Islam, several decades after Muhammad's death. Modern Muslims believe that Muhammad was
            transported from the Great Mosque of Mecca to this location during the Night Journey. Islamic tradition
            holds that Muhammad led prayers towards this site until the 16th or 17th month after his migration from
            Mecca to Medina, when Allah directed him to instead turn towards the Kaaba in Mecca.[2]

            The covered mosque building was originally a small prayer house erected by Umar, the second caliph of the
            Rashidun Caliphate, after the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the early 7th century. It was rebuilt and
            expanded by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik and finished by his son al-Walid in 705. The mosque was
            completely destroyed by an earthquake in 746 and rebuilt by the Abbasid caliph al-

        Mansur in 754. It was
        rebuilt again in 780. Another earthquake destroyed most of al-Aqsa in 1033, but two years later the Fatimid
        caliph Ali az-Zahir built another mosque whose outline is preserved in the current structure. The mosaics on
        the arch at the qibla end of the nave also go back to his time.[citation needed]

        During the periodic renovations undertaken, the various ruling dynasties of the Islamic Caliphate
        constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, facade, its minbar, minarets and
        the interior structure. When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, they used the mosque as a palace and
        the Dome of the Rock as a church. The structure was also the headquarters of the religious order of the
        Knights Templar. After the area was recaptured by Saladin in 1187, the structure's function as a mosque was
        restored. More renovations, repairs and additions were undertaken in later centuries by the Ayyubids,
        Mamluks, Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council, and Jordan. Today, the Old City is under Israeli control, but
        the mosque remains under the administration of the Jordanian/Palestinian-led Islamic Waqf.[3]

        The mosque is located in close proximity to historical sites significant in Judaism and Christianity, most
        notably the site of the Second Temple, the holiest site in Judaism. As a result, the area is highly
        sensitive, and has been a flashpoint in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[4]
